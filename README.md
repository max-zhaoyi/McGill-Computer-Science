# McGill-Computer-Science
various notable projects I have made while attending McGill
Most were coded in Java, the image processing utility was coded in Assembly (MIPS) and the CSV utility was written in C

Remote Procedure Call, Threading Library and Memory Allocation Library were written in C, designed to compile and run on UNIX machines.
