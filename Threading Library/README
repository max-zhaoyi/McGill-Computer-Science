
after make or make run use:

 gcc -o test test.c a1_lib.o sut.o -pthread


-Code will hang if a 16th thread gets created; assumption that we will only be creating a maximum of 15 threads.
-sut_read not implemented: always return string "Read has not been implemented!"

-For I/O, only one command can be run per user thread, and only the last I/O command is run properly (ex. when called sut_open followed by sut_close, only sut_close will run). It seems like my queue is overwriting itself

-Feel free to use the #DEBUG# print statements around my i-exec queue pop to see what I did wrong..

-Can you please go into my i-exec and check if my functions (commented in CAPS) are implemented well there? for partials marks?
